### Machine Learning Methods That Economists Should Know About

Economics research uses data models, while machine learning papers use algorithmic models.

ML is more about prediction, and it cares about out-of-sample cross-validation. 

Econ cares about formal properties, like consistency, normality, efficiency, and confidence intervals, while ML cares about guarantees of error rates.

Econ uses hand-selected explanatory variables, while ML chooses them in a data-dependent manner.

ML cares about the computation efficiency of large data sets, like LASSO and SGD.

ML uses model averaging, a combination of possibly quite different models, averaged using weights obtained by optimizing out-of-sample performance.
