#### Are Judges Like Umpires? Political Affiliation and Corporate Prosecutions

Judges appointed by a democrat president impose larger fines for corporate crimes involving environmental and labor regulations while Republican-appointed judges impose larger fines for crimes involving the hiring of illegal immigrants.

To assess whether judicial political affiliations affect the outcomes of corporate prosecutions, they construct data on federal corporate prosecutions and the political affiliation of federal judges, which are nominated by the President for lifetime appointments. And judges do have political preferences. Once cases are assigned to a prosecution office in the US, a judge is **randomly selected** from the federal judges that preside over that particular jurisdiction.

Difference-in-differences

Dependent variables can be the type of decision of guilt, or fine if pleaded guilty. 

Core intersection item is Democrat*DemocratTilt

Democrat = 1 if the judge is nominated by a Democrat President, 0 if Republican.

DemocratTilt = 1 if cases involving labor or environmental crimes; -1 if immigration crimes; 0 if crimes that do not easily lend themselves to a partisan classification, like fraud, money laundering, and bribery 

Control for judge, crime type, and year fixed effects.

#### Do Shareholders Gain from Their Right to Sue? Evidence from Federal Judge Turnover

Shareholders’ right to sue corporations and managers for breach of securities laws causes equity value loss.

While federal securities laws are the same across all public firms and U.S. states, federal judges likely exercise considerable discretion in the actual enforcement of these laws and hence influence the outcomes of shareholder lawsuits. They classify U.S. federal judges’ as pro-shareholder or pro-business and show that pro-shareholder judges are indeed more likely to rule against (in favor of) the early dismissal of shareholder lawsuit. Use judicial turnover events in federal court as shocks to shareholders’ right to sue, and study the impact of stronger shareholder rights for equity value. Examine abnormal stock returns around judicial turnover events that affect the average friendliness of a court toward shareholder rights.
