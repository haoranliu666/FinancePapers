#### Are Judges Like Umpires? Political Affiliation and Corporate Prosecutions

Judges appointed by a democrat president impose larger fines for corporate crimes involving environmental and labor regulations while Republican-appointed judges impose larger fines for crimes involving the hiring of illegal immigrants.

To assess whether judicial political affiliations affect the outcomes of corporate prosecutions, we construct data on federal corporate prosecutions and the political affiliation of federal judges, which are nominated by the President for lifetime appointments. Once cases are assigned to a prosecution office in the US, a judge is **randomly selected** from the federal judges that preside over that particular jurisdiction.

Difference-in-differences; control for judge, crime, and year fixed effects.
